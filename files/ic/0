[b]hi ICPLAYER! This is your IC confessional where you can put the thoughts that you think while you are playing the game to help the newer players afterwards. You can put stuff you notice that you don't want to say in real time or whatever you want! The confessional is optional so you don't have to post in it if you don't want.

This thread will be released to the public after the game. You aren't allowed to quote the PT at all. 

I've made you a moderator of this topic so you should be able to edit your posts for typos if you want to, but please don't make it public (I'll do that promptly at the end of the game) or add anyone else to this topic.
