[area=Mafia 1-shot Strongman]Welcome!

You are a [b][color=red]Mafia 1-shot strongman[/color][/b].

Once during the game, when you commit the factional kill, you can choose to make a strongman kill, which cannot be blocked by any means.

You and your partner share a factional kill each night. You must choose which of you will commit the kill. You may commit the kill and perform a roleblock in the same night phase. You also share a factional PT, located [url=MAFIATHREAD]here[/url], where you may talk at any time.

[b]You win when the Town has been eliminated, or nothing can stop this from occurring.[/b]

The game thread is [url=PUBLICTHREAD]here[/url].

Confirm by replying with your role name and alignment or by posting in your PT.[/area]
