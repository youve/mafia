[area=Mafia Rolecop]Welcome!

You are a [b][color=red]Mafia Rolecop[/color][/b].

You may target one player per night phase. At the end of the night phase, you will be informed of their role but not their alignment.  [color=green]Vanilla Townies[/color] and [color=red]Mafia Goons[/color] will both return "Vanilla". If you are roleblocked, you will receive no result.

You and your partner share a factional kill each night. You must choose which of you will commit the kill. You may commit the kill and perform a role cop in the same night phase. You also share a factional PT, located [url=MAFIATHREAD]here[/url], where you may talk at any time.

[b]You win when the Town has been eliminated, or nothing can stop this from occurring.[/b]

The game thread is [url=PUBLICTHREAD]here[/url].

Confirm by replying with your role name and alignment or by posting in your PT.[/area]
