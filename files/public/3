[b][i]Key Concepts and Tips[/i][/b]

[b][u]Activity[/u][/b]

[b]Try to check in at least once a day.[/b] Besides the activity requirements listed in the moderator's original post, it's just necessary for a fun and healthy game that everyone [i]plays[/i]. If you post very rarely, or only post a little bit at a time, you may get scumread for lurking. Even if you are not scumread for it, what's the fun in playing a game where multiple people are hardly participating?

[b][u]Site Meta[/u][/b] 

Meta is the description of how people on Mafiascum like to play mafia. Things can be different on other online mafia sites, or if you play IRL, so it's good to know what's expected of you on this site. These aren't "rules", per se, but if you don't follow these guidelines it is likely things will go poorly for you on MS. Some examples are...

[b][u]Random Voting Stage (RVS)[/u][/b]
Games on MafiaScum almost always begin with what we call the Random Voting Stage (RVS).  At this point in the game, we are in a low information game state (except the mafia, which know everyone’s alignment).  As a way to provoke reaction, start a discussion, and try to determine alignment, people will usually vote for non-serious reasons.  As the discussion progresses, we will eventually get the game moving and progress out of RVS.

[b][u]Voting, L-x, and Hammers[/u][/b] 
L-x is a way to convey how far away a player is away from a lynch.  For example, you should always announce that you are putting someone at L-1 (1 vote away from a lynch) so that someone doesn’t come along and accidentally vote for that players lynch.  This also prevents Mafia-aligned players from coming along and placing the final vote to lynch (“hammer”) and claiming ignorance about doing so.  You may also see L-2 and L-3 (2 votes away from a lynch and 3 votes away from a lynch, respectively).  

Before you hammer a player, state your intent to hammer (usually done in bold) and ask the player to claim their role. This is done to prevent power roles from being lynched, and can sometimes get Mafia-aligned players to be caught (via counter claiming).  It's best to then allow other players to react and discuss the claim before hammering.  


[u][b]Claiming Your Role[/b][/u]
It is almost always best to not claim your role unless you are at L-1 and have been asked to claim as part of an “intent to hammer.”  This is because, as a town power role (“PR”), if you out prematurely, you are likely to be night-killed (“NK’d”).  As a Vanilla Townie (“VT”), claiming early helps the mafia team narrow down the setup and possible PR candidates.  An exception to this would be if a mafia player claimed your role, claiming early to counter the false claim (“CC”) would out the mafia player, and would be a benefit to the town.  

[b]Do not fake claim a power role as town![/b] While it may help you avoid getting lynched, you might cause a real PR to out themselves by counter claiming - then the mafia will know who the PR is, and you will probably get lynched for lying to town. Feel free to fake a claim as scum, though, if you think it would help.

[b][u]LyLo[/u][/b]
LyLo is the shortened representation of “lynch or lose.” LyLo in the Newbie Queue is when there are 3 remaining players, 2 of which are town and 1 is mafia; or when there are 5 remaining players, 3 of which are town and 2 are mafia.  It is important in these situations that the town aligned players do not carelessly vote like is done during RVS or early days, as the mafia player(s) can organize and instantly provide the necessary votes to lynch (“quickhammer”) and win the game.

[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]
[b]Mafia is hard! [/b]As town, it can be hard to figure things out, and stressful when people think you're scum. [b]That's okay![/b] Just share your thoughts on who you think is scum as they come to you, and don't be afraid to change your mind. As scum, it can be hard to lie convincingly, and stressful when people think you're scum. Don't let that scare you! Try to think of what you would post if you were town, and don't be afraid to "change your mind".

This is a game. [b]Have fun![/b][/area]
