Each Newbie Game will be given a setup that incorporates one mafia role from the top of a column, and then two town roles from a row below the selected mafia role.  The remaining six roles will be filled in by [color=#FF0000]one mafia goons[/color] and [color=#00FF00]five vanilla townies[/color] appropriately, to create a [color=#FF0000]2-mafia[/color] and [color=#00FF00]7-town[/color] setup.  

All Newbie games use the [wiki]Natural Action Resolution[/wiki] system for determining Night action effects.  [color=#FF0000]Mafia Roleblocker [/color] action takes precedence over a [color=#00FF00]Town Jailkeeper[/color] action should that apply.

Mafia can communicate in their Private Topic at all times.
